## Transcript
- [00:04] [Music]
- [00:20] Good afternoon everyone. Uh my name is
- [00:22] Ragu Rajan and a few weeks ago I took
- [00:26] over from Mark Carney who's away doing
- [00:29] something else. Uh as uh as chairman of
- [00:32] the group of 30. Uh as you might know
- [00:36] the group of 30 was established uh
- [00:39] around 50 years ago. We are an
- [00:42] independent global body comprised of
- [00:44] economic and financial leaders from the
- [00:46] public and private sectors as well as
- [00:49] academia.
- [00:51] What we hope to do is deepen our
- [00:54] collective understanding of global
- [00:56] economic and financial issues and to
- [00:59] explore the international repercussions
- [01:02] of decisions taken in the public and
- [01:05] private
- [01:06] sectors. At a time of growing
- [01:08] nationalism and rapidly changing global
- [01:11] dynamics, our role in fostering debate
- [01:14] and reflection has, in my view, become
- [01:17] even more important.
- [01:19] This spring lecture where we are joined
- [01:22] by so many friends and supporters from
- [01:24] the financial
- [01:26] community both from the public sector as
- [01:29] well as the private sector and from
- [01:31] across the globe is a continuation of
- [01:35] this process of debate and
- [01:37] reflection. I'm glad to see so many of
- [01:40] you here. We're also joined on live
- [01:43] stream by many members of the G30
- [01:46] community. Thank you very much for
- [01:48] participating in this
- [01:50] process. Also for the speakers today,
- [01:53] let me emphasize that we have members of
- [01:56] the press with us. Uh they're certainly
- [01:58] most welcome and however it does mean
- [02:02] that everything that is said today uh
- [02:04] including the Q&A session are on the
- [02:08] record. Today's lecture will be
- [02:10] presented by Kevin Walsh, a member and
- [02:14] trustee of the group of 30. But before
- [02:17] we hear him, let me first thank managing
- [02:20] director Christina Georgva and the
- [02:23] International Monetary Fund for hosting
- [02:26] us and continuing to offer us their
- [02:30] hospitality. Now, let me invite the
- [02:32] managing director to give opening
- [02:34] remarks and to introduce the speaker.
- [02:38] [Applause]
- [02:43] Uh thank you very much Rau. Uh it is my
- [02:48] great honor and pleasure
- [02:51] uh to be with you today. I'm very proud
- [02:55] that the IMF ranks produce many of the
- [03:00] G30
- [03:02] members. Um and I promise we will
- [03:05] produce more.
- [03:07] Uh I hope you are having a good spring
- [03:10] meetings. Uh it was certainly very busy
- [03:13] time uh for me. Uh and on this u uh
- [03:18] event I think I would have the privilege
- [03:22] to introduce the speaker and then just
- [03:25] sit and
- [03:26] listen.
- [03:29] Um our speaker is fantastic. Kevin Walsh
- [03:34] spent much of his career working on
- [03:38] critical monetary policy and financial
- [03:40] sector issues. So just listen to my
- [03:44] introduction if you don't know him. He
- [03:46] went to
- [03:48] Stanford, Harvard and
- [03:51] MIT. He worked on Wall
- [03:55] Street. He advised President George W.
- [03:58] Bush on capital markets and banking
- [04:01] issues.
- [04:02] He then was the youngest ever appointee
- [04:06] to the Federal Reserve Board and served
- [04:10] with great distinction during the global
- [04:13] financial crisis where he was the Fed's
- [04:16] main liazison to both Wall Street and
- [04:20] the G20. His
- [04:23] expertise about the inner workings of
- [04:26] the financial system proved invaluable
- [04:29] to help the Fed restore financial
- [04:32] stability and avert an even deeper
- [04:36] downturn. Kevin is now back to
- [04:39] Stanford as a lecturer at the Stanford
- [04:42] School of Business and a visiting fellow
- [04:46] at the Hoover Institution. He also sits
- [04:49] on the panel of economic adviserss to
- [04:52] the Congressional Budget
- [04:54] Office among other
- [04:56] things. Uh the theme of Kevin's speech
- [04:59] is monetary policy at a
- [05:04] crossroad and um uh oh you haven't put
- [05:08] the uh the title of the speech on the
- [05:11] screen. Okay. Well, that is the title.
- [05:15] Uh it is indeed appropriate to take
- [05:18] stock after the biggest inflation surge
- [05:21] in several decades and for central
- [05:24] bankers to consider what needs to be
- [05:27] done to achieve their goal in a world
- [05:30] that is more shockprone and changing
- [05:34] faster than ever.
- [05:36] If you look back at the most recent
- [05:39] period, many central banks have made
- [05:42] good progress in bringing inflation back
- [05:45] down to near
- [05:46] target by keeping inflation expectations
- [05:50] anchored. They reduced the impact on
- [05:53] output and
- [05:57] employment. But it is not over yet.
- [06:02] Inflation has not been defeated and in
- [06:04] many countries it is still above target
- [06:07] and new shocks including major shifts in
- [06:10] trade
- [06:11] policies in some places may boost
- [06:15] inflation again while weakening economic
- [06:18] growth.
- [06:21] Any central bank with a mandate that
- [06:23] includes both price and employment
- [06:27] stability will face very difficult
- [06:30] choices. But it is vital to ensure that
- [06:34] high inflation pressures do not become
- [06:38] entrenched, especially if inflation has
- [06:41] already run well above target for
- [06:44] several years.
- [06:47] Beyond the current conjuncture, the
- [06:50] recent high inflation experience
- [06:52] requires us to think about what needs to
- [06:56] change to help central bankers deal with
- [06:59] a more unstable
- [07:01] world.
- [07:03] Clearly, the existing models fell short
- [07:07] in predicting the size and persistence
- [07:10] of the inflation surge.
- [07:13] We assumed that the stimulus deployed
- [07:16] during the pandemic which was
- [07:19] necessary would produce only temporary
- [07:23] inflation. And we all have to be humble
- [07:26] to
- [07:27] recognize that was not the case. So now
- [07:31] researchers do need to improve their
- [07:34] inflation models and rethink how central
- [07:39] banks should act.
- [07:42] We are paying much more attention to
- [07:44] supply shocks than before the pandemic.
- [07:47] And after many years worrying that
- [07:50] inflation would go too low. Remember
- [07:52] these years, we need again to worry
- [07:55] about a the risk of inflation being too
- [08:00] high. One key issue would be to
- [08:03] distinguish when to wait and when to
- [08:06] act. How do we tell when a supply shock
- [08:10] is temporary and just ride it out and
- [08:14] when it is time to tighten monetary
- [08:17] policy? I know that staff at various
- [08:21] central banks and here at the front are
- [08:24] thinking deeply about these and other
- [08:27] critical issues related to monetary
- [08:29] policy frameworks uh and their
- [08:32] implementation. uh and I am so grateful
- [08:35] to Kevin that he is going to give some
- [08:41] insights. He would tell us how we can
- [08:46] step up again to what is expected from
- [08:50] us. Please welcome Kevin to the
- [08:52] [Applause]
- [09:01] stage. Uh, Cristina Ragu, thank you very
- [09:04] much. Very kind of you to uh to include
- [09:07] me today. Um, I think that as the
- [09:11] managing director said, this is a time
- [09:13] of huge consequence for the global
- [09:15] economy and inviting me. I take that as
- [09:18] a sign that policymakers consider this a
- [09:20] time ripe for robust debate and
- [09:23] deliberation, testing and truthtelling,
- [09:26] and ultimately a time for choosing
- [09:27] choosing what policy path we have. Now,
- [09:30] as Ragu said, there might be an
- [09:31] alternative reason why I was invited
- [09:33] today. Your first choice as speaker
- [09:36] cancelled to become prime
- [09:38] minister. Uh for those that are not from
- [09:41] the United States, I'm then playing the
- [09:43] role of substitute teacher, substitute
- [09:45] lecturer. In the US, when the substitute
- [09:48] lecturer comes, the students pay no
- [09:49] attention. They send paper airplanes.
- [09:52] So, but I hope because there's so many
- [09:54] non-Americans here, you take this like
- [09:56] uh it's a very serious thing. Uh for
- [09:58] people that have been following my views
- [10:00] on questions of central banks and
- [10:02] reforms, much of this will not be new,
- [10:05] but curiously I hear that there's some
- [10:07] new interest in my view. So I will
- [10:09] popularize some some old themes.
- [10:12] Um I'm here under no illusions. I think
- [10:16] as the managing director said, this is a
- [10:18] time of huge consequence and I don't
- [10:20] exactly think I'm here to the IMF and
- [10:22] the World Bank bringing coals to
- [10:24] Newcastle.
- [10:26] Modern Wilsonians might not be
- [10:28] completely comfortable with my words,
- [10:30] but it is not my disposition to grant
- [10:33] boundless power to government agencies
- [10:35] to fix the world. I come from a
- [10:37] different philosophical
- [10:39] bent. Some might believe that the
- [10:42] greatest threat to our economy in the US
- [10:45] and around the world comes from
- [10:47] outsiders. That is not my view. I
- [10:50] believe the predominant risks come from
- [10:52] the choices we make inside the four
- [10:54] walls of institutions just like this
- [10:57] one. This is a historic place and it's a
- [11:01] historic venue. Uh so it's an honor to
- [11:03] be here. It's especially an honor for
- [11:05] me. My greatest mentor in my
- [11:08] professional life was George Schultz who
- [11:10] passed away at age 100 in the middle of
- [11:12] COVID. And George thought that these
- [11:15] institutions, including the IMF and the
- [11:18] World Bank, the other institutions that
- [11:20] helped define the post-war era, made the
- [11:23] 20th century more peaceful and more
- [11:26] prosperous. But before he passed, he
- [11:29] said in our penultimate lunch that this
- [11:32] was the greatest hinge point in history
- [11:35] of his life at age 100. And that was a
- [11:38] few years ago. I think if he were
- [11:39] sitting here with us now, and I feel him
- [11:42] here in some sense, he'd believe that's
- [11:45] still true. After World War II, the US
- [11:48] led a security and economic commons with
- [11:52] so many friends, so many allies in this
- [11:54] room that advanced the interests of
- [11:56] freedom and liberty for much of the 20th
- [11:59] century. It included very consequential
- [12:01] roles not just for the US, but friends
- [12:03] around the world. But as we sit here a
- [12:07] quarter of a century into the 21st
- [12:09] century, we have to recognize that the
- [12:12] world looks decidedly less kind,
- [12:14] especially the least welloff among our
- [12:17] citizens. A series of shocks,
- [12:19] geopolitical, economic, and others have
- [12:22] been fierce and
- [12:24] frequent. And the key economic
- [12:26] institutions that served us well for
- [12:29] decades have in more recent periods
- [12:31] fallen short of their
- [12:33] promises. Absent fundamental reform, we
- [12:36] need to ask ourselves whether their high
- [12:38] summer is
- [12:40] passed. In my view, strengthening
- [12:43] economic
- [12:44] performance requires improving economic
- [12:48] governance. That means new ideas, and
- [12:50] I'll talk about a few of them, but I'll
- [12:52] also say a word about
- [12:54] institutions. It means reforming and in
- [12:57] some cases restoring institutions to
- [12:59] their first principles.
- [13:02] To be trusted, as most of us know who
- [13:04] have been in around Washington, other
- [13:06] capitals, economic institutions must be
- [13:10] trustworthy. To be trustworthy, they
- [13:13] must prove themselves to be competent in
- [13:16] good times and bad in all sorts of
- [13:18] cycles. Economic institutions must also
- [13:21] maintain deep humility. Managing
- [13:24] director mentioned that in her remarks,
- [13:26] and I think it's a useful reminder for
- [13:27] us all. There are limits to what any of
- [13:30] us can know about what's happening in
- [13:32] markets and the economy and limits to
- [13:34] what we can know about the consequences
- [13:36] of our policy
- [13:37] choices. Leaders of these institutions
- [13:40] have to abide by other limits. Some
- [13:42] imposed by the constitution, others
- [13:44] imposed by parliaments and
- [13:46] legislatures and maybe most important
- [13:49] limits imposed by the good judgment of
- [13:51] people that are tasked with leading
- [13:53] these organizations.
- [13:55] There is an inherent tendency of
- [13:57] government organizations to expand their
- [13:59] footprint and leaders need to help
- [14:01] police
- [14:02] that. Institutions also must be
- [14:05] permitted to act. We can't know in any
- [14:07] definitive sense what's around the
- [14:09] corner over the hill, but we need to act
- [14:12] within well-defined exanti frameworks.
- [14:15] It's not all just about cleaning up the
- [14:17] mess
- [14:17] afterwards. And finally, institutions
- [14:20] need to be accountable.
- [14:22] The greater the power of the public
- [14:24] institution and I see a lot of powerful
- [14:26] institutions represented in this room.
- [14:29] The greater the responsibility to
- [14:31] explain and answer questions about their
- [14:35] decisions. So I'll turn this a little
- [14:37] bit more personally. Every philosophy is
- [14:40] a memoir of sorts. So you're going to
- [14:42] hear a little bit of my memoir. I think
- [14:44] it's Nietze who said that. Uh I would
- [14:46] want to give proper uh uh uh
- [14:49] credit. So my focus today will be on an
- [14:52] economic institution that I'm more
- [14:54] familiar with, the Federal Reserve. You
- [14:57] can judge whether any of these lessons,
- [14:59] any of these stories have consequences
- [15:01] for the institutions that you represent.
- [15:04] For those who don't know, I was a member
- [15:05] of the board of governors at the Fed
- [15:07] more than a dozen years ago. I still
- [15:10] have the scars to show for the darkest
- [15:13] days of the financial crisis in 2008
- [15:16] and9. The debate in Chairman Bernankei's
- [15:18] office were intense. more intense,
- [15:21] frankly, than I've read about in all
- [15:22] these books. But they were also quite
- [15:25] civil, quite
- [15:27] consequential. And where I give Chairman
- [15:29] Bernanki the most credit was he
- [15:31] surrounded himself not with people who
- [15:33] agreed with him on everything, but he
- [15:35] surrounded himself truly with a team of
- [15:37] rivals. And so we'd have incredible
- [15:39] fights about what to do because none of
- [15:41] us knew. And he would decide and we
- [15:44] would largely fall in line. But that's
- [15:47] the right lesson it strikes me from that
- [15:49] period of
- [15:50] crisis. Nothing about that period was
- [15:52] easy. Maybe with the benefit of history,
- [15:54] it looks like the outcomes were all
- [15:56] quite known. I should say we made plenty
- [15:59] of good calls and plenty of mistakes
- [16:01] both. Inevitably, the hardest question
- [16:04] then and I think the most salient
- [16:06] question for thus for us today was the
- [16:09] Fed's role and responsibility.
- [16:12] I remember after one particularly
- [16:14] intense uh weekend in 2008, we had come
- [16:19] up with a new scheme to try to bring
- [16:21] some liquidity back to markets and we
- [16:23] were feeling okay about
- [16:25] ourselves. Uh former chairman Paul
- [16:27] Vulker was at the New York Economic Club
- [16:30] and I'll quote what he said, but I
- [16:32] remember hearing it in real time. He
- [16:35] said, quote, "The Fed has gone to the
- [16:38] very edge of its lawful and implied
- [16:41] power, transcending certain long
- [16:44] embedded central banking principles and
- [16:47] practices." Well, we took that as the
- [16:50] equivalent of a brushback pitch, high
- [16:53] and tight. For the non-Americans, that's
- [16:55] a baseball expression. When you want to
- [16:57] tell the the the Hall of Fame batter,
- [17:00] it's not going to be so easy. And we
- [17:03] were struck. Well, let me speak for
- [17:04] myself. I was struck by that. But we
- [17:07] continue to work and grind through the
- [17:09] crisis. As I sit here today in
- [17:12] 2025, I have to admit that Vulkar's
- [17:15] warning has gone largely unheeded. Even
- [17:18] to this day, changes in the role of the
- [17:21] US central bank have been more have been
- [17:24] so pervasive as to be nearly invisible.
- [17:28] The Fed has assumed a much more
- [17:30] expansive role inside of our government
- [17:32] on all matters of economic policy.
- [17:35] Whether you like it or don't like it, we
- [17:38] should admit of that growing role. The
- [17:41] Fed has also moved into matters of state
- [17:43] craft and soul craft too. In my view, as
- [17:46] we think back over the most recent
- [17:48] period of years, forays far a field, for
- [17:52] all seasons and all reasons and with the
- [17:55] best of intentions have led to
- [17:57] systematic errors in the conduct of
- [17:59] macroeconomic policy. The Fed has acted
- [18:02] more as a general purpose agency of our
- [18:06] government than a narrow central bank
- [18:09] that preceded my days as a central
- [18:11] banker.
- [18:13] Institutional drift has coincided with
- [18:15] the Fed's failure to establish and
- [18:18] achieve an essential part of its
- [18:20] statutory remmit, price stability, and
- [18:23] the Fed's outsized role and
- [18:26] underperformance have weakened the
- [18:28] important and worthy case for monetary
- [18:30] policy independence.
- [18:34] This could be a parochial view I'm going
- [18:36] to express, but the Fed's probably the
- [18:39] most important, consequential,
- [18:41] influential economic agency in the
- [18:44] world. Its policy uh decisions, its
- [18:47] choices are transmitted through several
- [18:49] channels. We teach this in
- [18:51] macroeconomics to young business school
- [18:53] students. We talk about foreign exchange
- [18:55] channels and bond market channels and
- [18:57] confidence channels, asset price
- [18:59] channels.
- [19:01] The most important channel, however, is
- [19:04] intellectual. That's what I've come to
- [19:06] speak to you about. And I think that's
- [19:08] why, as the managing director said,
- [19:10] that's why we're all here at this
- [19:12] consequential moment. So, my lecture
- [19:15] today is more a political treatise than
- [19:17] how to
- [19:18] guide. My hope is that it's received in
- [19:22] the spirits it's intended. It's more a
- [19:24] love letter than it is a cold critique.
- [19:27] because I was a central banker and
- [19:29] understand the essential role that the
- [19:32] Fed and so many organizations in this
- [19:34] room play. In order to get to the meat
- [19:36] of that
- [19:38] philosophy, see if I can first set aside
- [19:41] some of what I describe as the fast food
- [19:44] of central banking. That's part of the
- [19:47] current practice of monetary policy. We
- [19:50] can move that aside. I think we can turn
- [19:52] to a more nutritious meal.
- [19:55] First, frequent changes to the Fed's
- [19:57] metrics, including its professed
- [20:00] preferred measure of inflation, are
- [20:02] beneath the high standing of any central
- [20:04] bank. Central bank credibility is the
- [20:08] coin that purchases American economic
- [20:12] strength. In Washington, especially in
- [20:15] Washington, a central banker can ill
- [20:17] afford to be anything other than a
- [20:19] straight shooter.
- [20:21] Second, I do not find the current Fed
- [20:25] policy, which has gone on from my day,
- [20:27] of data dependence to be of much value.
- [20:31] When pushed on that, I say there's only
- [20:33] two problems with data dependence, the
- [20:35] data and the dependence.
- [20:39] We should care very little about what's
- [20:41] happening two numbers to the right of
- [20:43] the decimal point in the latest
- [20:44] government
- [20:45] release. Breathlessly awaiting trailing
- [20:48] government data from stale national
- [20:51] accounts, subject to
- [20:54] revision subsequent to significant
- [20:56] change is evidence of false precision in
- [21:00] this business that we're in and subject
- [21:02] to a lot of analytic complacency. If
- [21:04] financial markets want to follow that,
- [21:06] that's okay. But we central bankers need
- [21:09] to recognize the error in that data.
- [21:12] Third, near-term
- [21:14] forecasting. That was just starting to
- [21:17] become common when I left the Fed. I
- [21:20] view for central bankers, it's all too
- [21:22] common today. It's a distracting Fed
- [21:26] preoccupation. Econ uh economists are
- [21:29] not immune to the frailities of human
- [21:31] nature. Once policymakers, myself
- [21:34] included, reveal their economic forecast
- [21:37] to the world, they often become
- [21:39] prisoners of their own
- [21:41] words. Fed leaders would be well served
- [21:44] to skip opportunities to share their
- [21:46] latest
- [21:47] musings. The swivel chair problem, as a
- [21:50] friend described it to me once,
- [21:52] rhetorically waxing and waning with the
- [21:54] latest data release is common and it's
- [21:57] counterproductive.
- [21:59] Central banker's jobs is not to have the
- [22:01] perfect forecast. It's to make the best
- [22:04] decision. So I ask myself whether this
- [22:07] frequent repetition of forecasts and
- [22:09] dots is helping us get to the right
- [22:11] decision when new facts come in or it's
- [22:14] actually hurting. Fourth, forward
- [22:17] guidance. It's a related tool rolled out
- [22:19] to great fanfare in the financial
- [22:21] crisis. I recall in the darkest days of
- [22:24] '08 trying to say that the Fed is
- [22:27] locking its own hands behind its back
- [22:29] because we wanted markets to know we
- [22:31] weren't going to quit. So in crisis
- [22:33] times I I could be persuaded that
- [22:36] forward guidance should come back. But
- [22:38] it has little role to play in my view in
- [22:40] normal times. Moving markets with
- [22:43] rolling incantations is tempting but
- [22:46] unhelpful to the Fed's deliberations and
- [22:49] ultimately its mission. The central bank
- [22:52] should find new comfort in working
- [22:54] without applause and without the
- [22:57] audience at the edge of its
- [22:58] seats. Now that I've gotten that off my
- [23:02] chest, we can turn to a more substantial
- [23:05] offering. So the question I think that's
- [23:08] to me the core issue at this time and
- [23:11] place is what happened? How did it
- [23:15] happen that we now live in a world of
- [23:17] what I describe as central bank
- [23:19] dominance?
- [23:21] From the early 1990s until the
- [23:25] GFC, the world was rightly
- [23:28] impressed, myself included, with the
- [23:30] Fed's track record in ensuring price
- [23:33] stability and financial
- [23:35] stability. Central bank chiefs became
- [23:37] household names, their credibility
- [23:41] unchallenged. Their opinions were highly
- [23:44] sought. They became more recognizable to
- [23:47] the man on the street. But I'll add less
- [23:51] recognizable day after day to their
- [23:54] predecessors. In exigent circumstances,
- [23:57] the Fed is called into action, extending
- [24:00] its reach and amplifying its
- [24:02] effect. And that was the reason why the
- [24:04] modern Fed was created in 1913 to
- [24:07] respond to panics. Was not created to do
- [24:10] these other things, but to be a crisis
- [24:12] manager. But when panics subside, the
- [24:16] Fed, it strikes me as duty bound to
- [24:18] retrace its steps. And for many decades,
- [24:22] after shocks dissipated, economic
- [24:24] conditions normalized, the Fed largely
- [24:27] and dutifully exited the main
- [24:31] stage. In more recent years, the Fed has
- [24:34] found its way onto the front pages of
- [24:36] our newspapers, not just in crisis
- [24:39] times, but all
- [24:41] times. The Fed has found it harder, it
- [24:44] strikes me, because Fed leaders are
- [24:46] human, too, to insulate themselves from
- [24:49] all the
- [24:50] attention. Its leaders wear their
- [24:52] inheritance proudly. When I served, I
- [24:55] know I did. So, my inquiry is not about
- [24:58] motivations. We're not in search of some
- [25:00] nefarious plot. If that were the case,
- [25:03] this would be easy. My review is about
- [25:06] capabilities and authorities. And since
- [25:08] the panic of 2008, central bank
- [25:11] dominance has become a key and new
- [25:13] feature of American
- [25:15] governance. Let me give a few
- [25:18] examples. I'll first turn to fiscal
- [25:21] policy. I won't be making any news here
- [25:24] to say that US fiscal policy is on a
- [25:27] dangerous
- [25:29] trajectory.
- [25:30] Irresponsibility in spending has surged,
- [25:33] especially in the aftermath of CO.
- [25:36] Today, the US federal government is
- [25:40] spending in excess of 60% more than the
- [25:44] day before CO. And I don't remember the
- [25:46] day before CO thinking this is one
- [25:48] auster, efficient, well-run government.
- [25:51] I remember thinking, well, there's got
- [25:53] to be plenty of easy cutting to be done.
- [25:55] 60% more. No plausible economic growth
- [25:59] can deliver revenues to match that surge
- [26:02] in spending.
- [26:04] Now, I struggled to absolve the Fed of
- [26:07] the nation's fiscal
- [26:09] profleacy. Fed leaders encouraged
- [26:13] government spending when times were
- [26:14] tough a few years back, but did not call
- [26:17] for fiscal discipline, when times were
- [26:20] good, at times of sustained growth and
- [26:22] full employment. Now, left to my own
- [26:25] devices, I'd prefer monetary
- [26:28] policymakers to steer clear of fiscal
- [26:30] commentary altogether.
- [26:32] But if the Fed chooses, especially under
- [26:35] exigent circumstances, to cross that
- [26:37] line, there should be real and
- [26:39] rhetorical
- [26:40] symmetry. That however is scarcely my
- [26:43] chief concern. That one is pretty easily
- [26:46] fixed. And I trust the Fed is in the
- [26:49] process of trying to fix
- [26:50] that. So what's the bigger concern about
- [26:53] the Fed and fiscal policy?
- [26:56] The Fed has been the most important
- [26:58] buyer of US government debt and other
- [27:00] liabilities backed by the US since
- [27:04] 2008. The Fed's $7 trillion balance
- [27:07] sheet today is nearly an order of
- [27:10] magnitude larger than the day I joined
- [27:11] the Fed. And I think it's a fair proxy
- [27:14] for the Fed's growing impimeter on our
- [27:17] economy. Now, from my time long ago as a
- [27:20] governor, I bear some measure of
- [27:22] responsibility for this creation of
- [27:24] asset
- [27:25] purchases. We tried to market it as
- [27:27] credit easing that lasted about a week.
- [27:30] You all called it quantitative easing,
- [27:31] so I'll go with
- [27:33] QE. So, in the '08 crisis, we cut
- [27:35] interest rates to zero, and it wasn't
- [27:38] enough. So, we sought new ways to make
- [27:41] monetary policy looser, to make
- [27:43] financial markets more liquid. And I
- [27:46] strongly supported this crisis time
- [27:48] innovation. But when the crisis ended,
- [27:52] the Fed never
- [27:53] retreated. I worried mightily in the
- [27:55] fall of 2010, a time of strong growth
- [27:58] and financial stability, the decision to
- [28:01] buy still more Treasury bonds, would
- [28:04] involve the Fed in the messy political
- [28:07] business of fiscal
- [28:09] policy. QE2 was announced. I disagreed
- [28:13] with the path of policy and resigned
- [28:16] from the Fed shortly
- [28:18] thereafter. QE with fits and starts
- [28:21] since
- [28:22] 2010 have become a near permanent
- [28:25] feature of central bank policy and
- [28:28] power.
- [28:30] fiscal policy makers, you know, the
- [28:32] folks at the other end of Constitution
- [28:34] Avenue, the elected members of Congress,
- [28:37] they found it considerably easier from
- [28:40] that day until this to appropriate money
- [28:43] knowing the government, central bank
- [28:46] would be subsidizing the costs of it.
- [28:49] Economics teaches a couple of lessons.
- [28:52] One, lowering the near-term cost of debt
- [28:55] tends to increase its
- [28:57] quantum. And two, on the current
- [29:00] trajectory, the high debt burden
- [29:03] threatens to undermine future economic
- [29:06] growth. The Fed presents itself as
- [29:09] humble and technocratic, queuing closely
- [29:11] to its remitt. They say they take fiscal
- [29:14] policy decisions as given and then react
- [29:18] accordingly. But it's no longer obvious
- [29:20] to me whether monetary policy is
- [29:23] downstream or upstream from fiscal
- [29:25] policy. Irresponsibility has a way of
- [29:28] running in both
- [29:30] directions. At conferences like this for
- [29:32] decades, the language we would hear
- [29:34] would be concerns I thought were quite
- [29:37] valid about fiscal
- [29:39] dominance where the nation's debts might
- [29:41] constrain monetary policymakers make
- [29:44] might make us to make a decision because
- [29:46] we're worried about our own nation's
- [29:49] debt. It was long thought to be a
- [29:51] possible end state. My view is that
- [29:55] monetary dominance rather than fiscal
- [29:58] dominance, monetary dominance where the
- [30:00] central bank becomes the ultimate
- [30:02] arbiter of fiscal policy is the clearer
- [30:05] and more present danger. The line
- [30:08] between the st central bank and the
- [30:10] ostensible fiscal authority has grown
- [30:13] harder to
- [30:14] identify. The spirit of the Treasury Fed
- [30:17] Accord of
- [30:19] 1951 is at odds with recent
- [30:22] practice. Now coming out of COVID, we
- [30:26] all to some degree or another became
- [30:27] amateur immunologists, myself included,
- [30:30] trying to figure out how to ward off
- [30:32] this virus. I learned a little
- [30:34] immunology which I think might have some
- [30:36] application here. At the time,
- [30:39] immunologists described a phenomena
- [30:41] where the immune system's response to a
- [30:44] virus might impede the response to a
- [30:47] subsequent variant. They call that
- [30:49] immunological
- [30:52] imprinting. So with that background, let
- [30:54] me make another theory that I'll propose
- [30:57] to you. I profer a theory of economic
- [31:00] imprinting whereby the policy choices of
- [31:03] prior
- [31:04] periods make the economy more vulnerable
- [31:07] to shocks and less able to adjust
- [31:10] organically. Each time the Fed jumps
- [31:12] into action, the more it expands its
- [31:15] size and scope, encroaching further on
- [31:18] other macroeconomic domains. More debt
- [31:21] is accumulated, more capital
- [31:24] misallocated, more institutional lines
- [31:26] cross, and the risks of future shocks
- [31:29] are
- [31:30] magnified, causing the Fed
- [31:33] obviously to act even more aggressively
- [31:36] when harm strikes. Simply stated, path
- [31:39] dependency is driving policy, and we
- [31:42] need to sit here at this moment and ask
- [31:45] ourselves whether it's driving it into a
- [31:47] ditch. It's not just dangerous to our
- [31:49] economy and to your economy. It's not
- [31:52] just risky business for central bank
- [31:55] legitimacy. It's riskiest for the least
- [31:57] welloff among our fellow
- [31:59] citizens. So that's my little riff on
- [32:01] fiscal policy. Um let me say something
- [32:04] about when the Fed wanders
- [32:08] further. The
- [32:10] enlightenment elevated the role of
- [32:12] reason and autonomy in decision-makings.
- [32:15] You can think of lock or Russo or
- [32:17] Emanuel Kant. None none could have
- [32:20] conceived of a central bank like ours.
- [32:22] Still a fundamental precept of their
- [32:24] thinking in the age of reason I think is
- [32:28] readily applicable to the modern
- [32:30] Fed. They held out a fierce resistance
- [32:34] to
- [32:36] whims. Central bankers and bandwagons
- [32:38] should be total strangers. It would be
- [32:41] better for the Fed's long-term success
- [32:44] to focus on the timehonored and the
- [32:46] enduring rather than the fashionable and
- [32:49] the
- [32:49] fleeting. I observe the modern central
- [32:52] bank, at least in my country, to be a
- [32:55] bit too willing to traffic in
- [32:57] contraband. Others can adjudicate
- [33:00] whether matters of cultural import are
- [33:02] in the province of the political uh uh
- [33:05] narrative or civil society, but the
- [33:07] Fed's business it is not.
- [33:11] Climate change and inclusion are
- [33:13] politically charged issues likely to put
- [33:16] half of the crowd into high dungeon to
- [33:18] even mention them. People of good
- [33:20] conscience have their own views, their
- [33:22] own motivations, their own policy
- [33:24] prescriptions. Take no issue with any of
- [33:26] that.
- [33:27] Elected officials are the ones tasked
- [33:30] with evaluating data, synthesizing
- [33:33] views, charting policy, and granting
- [33:35] authority if they so desire to executive
- [33:39] branch agencies. The Fed has neither the
- [33:42] expertise nor the prerogative to make
- [33:45] political judgments in these areas. The
- [33:47] Fed's remitt given to us by Congress.
- [33:50] It's not a suggestion or a jumping off
- [33:52] point. And as Supreme Court juristp
- [33:55] prudence makes clear, Congress is not in
- [33:58] the business of hiding elephants in
- [34:00] mouse holes. Let me give a couple of
- [34:03] examples to try to make this real. In
- [34:06] late 2020, the Fed joined something
- [34:08] called the network of central banks and
- [34:10] supervisors for greening the financial
- [34:12] system. The Fed said it's quote active
- [34:14] and in many cases playing a leading role
- [34:16] in climate related work. A year later,
- [34:20] the Fed said they had intensified their
- [34:22] focus on supervisory efforts on evolving
- [34:25] threats like climate change. Fast
- [34:28] forward to January of 2025, just a few
- [34:31] months ago in a somewhat different
- [34:34] political environment. The Fed withdrew
- [34:36] from the Greening Group and
- [34:38] substantially changed their
- [34:40] tune. Some of you might disagree with
- [34:42] one of those options or both of those
- [34:46] options. I think the match is what
- [34:48] bothers me perhaps most of all. Second,
- [34:52] in August of 2020 at Jackson Hole, the
- [34:55] Fed announced a new monetary policy
- [34:58] framework to much
- [35:00] fanfare. As I heard it then and think
- [35:02] about it now, the Fed's new regime was
- [35:04] their end of history
- [35:06] declaration. As Cristina said at the
- [35:10] beginning, high inflation they thought
- [35:12] was vanquished. The dominant risk would
- [35:14] was that prices would be too low. Well,
- [35:18] as we all know, history had other ideas.
- [35:21] As part of the new regime, they were
- [35:23] defi they redefined their legislative
- [35:25] remitt of maximum employment. The remit
- [35:28] given by the Congress as a quote
- [35:31] broad-based and inclusive goal. The new
- [35:34] nomenclature of inclusive employment was
- [35:37] understood to underscore the Fed's
- [35:39] willingness to accept higher inflation
- [35:42] so that certain groups could achieve
- [35:43] higher rates of employment. Or so the
- [35:45] theory
- [35:47] goes. More recently, Fed leadership has
- [35:50] sounded considerably more ambiguous
- [35:52] whether the new definition of full
- [35:54] employment was at all different from the
- [35:56] old. Well, if it's no different in
- [35:59] practice, then what was the new language
- [36:01] about? Was it politics or was it in fact
- [36:05] a change in policy? A new definition
- [36:08] that's different? Well, if that's true,
- [36:11] shouldn't Congress have had something to
- [36:12] say about that? I also have to note the
- [36:16] economics of this. The steepest price of
- [36:20] the new policy regime has been paid for
- [36:23] the last five years by the supposed
- [36:26] beneficiaries.
- [36:28] Now, there's a final reason to be
- [36:30] uncomfortable with the Fed's focus on
- [36:32] groups, and this goes to the profession
- [36:34] that we're all
- [36:36] practicing. Some in our profession have
- [36:38] tended to deemphasize
- [36:40] individuals, as if larger forces are in
- [36:44] charge. In my view, individuals rather
- [36:47] than groups are the core of civil
- [36:49] society and frankly the core of American
- [36:51] prosperity.
- [36:53] A successful Fed policy regime should
- [36:56] not view individuals as some cog in the
- [36:58] machine or as some fixed member of some
- [37:02] readily definable
- [37:04] group. What an individual does in the US
- [37:07] and around the world when he or she
- [37:09] wakes up in the morning matters
- [37:11] immeasurably to the path of the
- [37:14] economy. More broadly, I'll profer
- [37:17] another theory for you. The central bank
- [37:20] should consider adopting a principle of
- [37:22] institutional
- [37:24] neutrality pioneered in the university
- [37:27] context often associated with the
- [37:29] Chicago
- [37:30] principles. Neither the modern
- [37:32] university nor the modern central bank
- [37:34] has a comparative advantage. It strikes
- [37:36] me as a social justice organization.
- [37:39] Though they both do a lot of
- [37:41] good, they should avoid taking positions
- [37:44] on issues unless such matters plainly
- [37:46] threaten the core missions of those
- [37:50] institutions. The more the Fed opines on
- [37:53] matters outside of its remitt, the more
- [37:56] it jeopardizes its ability to ensure
- [37:59] stable prices and full employment and
- [38:01] the more vulnerable it becomes to the
- [38:05] body politique. The Fed's expansionist
- [38:09] tendencies portend existential
- [38:12] risks. Let me turn then to my final two
- [38:15] topics of inflation and I hesitate to
- [38:19] say
- [38:21] independence. On inflation, for about 40
- [38:24] years, the American people didn't have
- [38:26] to think about it.
- [38:29] And if the Fed's enviable track record
- [38:31] on price stability had continued through
- [38:34] this decade, I bet central bankers would
- [38:37] have been given a wider birth, I bet the
- [38:40] political class and the man on the
- [38:42] street might have looked the other way
- [38:44] to a fair bit of mission
- [38:45] creep. But then the Fed founder on
- [38:49] fundamentals and inflation surged.
- [38:52] The intellectual errors that contributed
- [38:54] to the great inflation include some mix
- [38:56] of the following. The central bank came
- [38:59] to believe that its price stability
- [39:01] objective was largely self-e executing.
- [39:05] Inflation was 2% because they said so.
- [39:08] They came to believe that these big box
- [39:11] big blackbox models including the DSG
- [39:14] models that are dominant at the Fed most
- [39:16] of the profession were anchored in
- [39:18] reality. Instead, they're just useful
- [39:20] ways for help us think about frame
- [39:22] issues to inform what's really
- [39:25] happening. Perhaps the Fed thought that
- [39:28] monetary policy had nothing to do with
- [39:31] money. That the central bank was a
- [39:34] bystander of forces outside of its
- [39:37] control. That the surge of Putin and the
- [39:40] pandemic were blamew worthy for
- [39:42] inflation, much more so than the surge
- [39:44] of government spending and government
- [39:46] printing.
- [39:48] Stable prices, it strikes me, were the
- [39:50] Fed's plot armor. For those who aren't
- [39:53] familiar with that term, I'll say this.
- [39:55] In Hollywood, if you go to your favorite
- [39:58] movie, I'm a James Bond fan. We worry
- [40:00] time and time again about whether James
- [40:02] is going to make it, whether the car is
- [40:04] going to go off the cliff with him. But
- [40:06] what 007s has is plot armor. Of course,
- [40:10] they can't kill him off. What the Fed
- [40:13] had was plot armor.
- [40:15] You might not like what the central bank
- [40:17] have been doing and this or that or been
- [40:19] critical like I was about wandering
- [40:21] away, but my goodness, they're pretty
- [40:23] good at those stable prices. So, we're
- [40:25] going to just have to give them a little
- [40:27] bit of
- [40:28] license. Like in the movies, it was
- [40:31] protections for the star against those
- [40:33] who would dare a challenge. But the
- [40:35] Fed's roving remitt and grand ambitions,
- [40:38] however well intended, have expanded its
- [40:41] surface area and exposed its
- [40:43] vulnerability.
- [40:45] So let's close this with a word on
- [40:47] central bank
- [40:49] independence. Central bank independence
- [40:51] is more often bandied than it is
- [40:53] defined. So let's give that a go.
- [40:56] Independence is not a policy goal unto
- [41:00] itself. It's a means a means of
- [41:03] achieving certain important and
- [41:05] particular policy outcomes.
- [41:08] Independence is reflexively declared a
- [41:11] bit too often for my taste when the Fed
- [41:14] is
- [41:16] criticized. But Congress has granted
- [41:18] important functions to the Federal
- [41:21] Reserve far removed from monetary
- [41:23] policy. I'm thinking for example of
- [41:25] banking and
- [41:27] supervision. I do not believe the Fed is
- [41:30] owed any particular difference in bank
- [41:32] regulatory or supervisory p policy.
- [41:36] Fed claims of independence in bank
- [41:38] manners undermine the case for
- [41:40] independence in the conduct of monetary
- [41:44] policy. And when the Fed turns away from
- [41:46] its creed and traditions, exercising
- [41:49] powers that were once in the province of
- [41:51] our Treasury Department, or take
- [41:53] positions on societal issues, whether
- [41:55] popular or not, it further jeopardize
- [41:58] jeopardizes the operational independence
- [42:01] in what matters most.
- [42:04] I studied economics more than I studied
- [42:06] law. But my parents wanted me to go to
- [42:08] law school. So in in their spirit as
- [42:10] they're looking down, I'll make a single
- [42:13] reference to the courts. Since Marberry
- [42:16] versus Madison, a famous case in
- [42:19] 1803, article 3 courts have been in the
- [42:22] business of policing article one and
- [42:24] article 2 powers. That is powers of the
- [42:26] congress and the president. And since
- [42:29] McCullik v. Maryland in 1819. The courts
- [42:33] have wrestled time after time about the
- [42:36] role and authority of a central bank in
- [42:38] our republic. Others are far better
- [42:41] situated than I to sort out the
- [42:42] constitutional imperatives and
- [42:44] legislative authorities of the current
- [42:46] conjuncture. But what I believe is this.
- [42:50] I strongly believe operational
- [42:52] independence in the conduct of monetary
- [42:55] policy is a wise political economy
- [42:58] decision.
- [43:00] And I believe Fed independence is
- [43:03] chiefly up to the
- [43:05] Fed. That doesn't mean central bankers
- [43:08] should be treated as pampered princes.
- [43:11] When monetary policy outcomes are poor,
- [43:13] the Fed should be subjected to serious
- [43:15] questioning, strong oversight, and even
- [43:20] approprium. But a narrow central bank,
- [43:22] we have to recognize, has more going for
- [43:24] it than mere tradition.
- [43:26] Our constitutional republic is accepting
- [43:29] of an independent central bank only if
- [43:32] it sticks to its congressionally
- [43:34] directed duty and successfully performs
- [43:37] its
- [43:38] task. Ours is after all our third
- [43:40] experiment in the US with a central bank
- [43:43] not because of the success of its
- [43:45] predecessors but their
- [43:47] failure. We don't become the third
- [43:49] central bank the way you win a third
- [43:51] Super Bowl like keep at it and we keep
- [43:53] giving you more. It's the third because
- [43:55] we've struggled with the questions that
- [43:57] are in the current policy conjuncture
- [43:59] since the founding of the
- [44:01] republic. And what's my historical
- [44:04] lesson from those old fights about the
- [44:06] Bank of the United
- [44:07] States? We should remember the revealed
- [44:10] preference of the body politic is a deep
- [44:13] distaste for
- [44:14] inflation also for bailouts and power
- [44:17] grabs. The governance objectives, it
- [44:20] strikes me as clear. It's to make the
- [44:23] central bank safe for democracy, not to
- [44:25] make democracy safe for the central
- [44:27] bank. So, in conclusion, before Ragu
- [44:31] comes up here and asks me a series of
- [44:33] tough questions, I should say the Fed's
- [44:36] current wounds are largely
- [44:39] self-inflicted, and its plot armor isn't
- [44:42] what it once was. A strategic reset is
- [44:45] necessary now more than ever to mitigate
- [44:49] losses of credibility, changes in
- [44:51] standing, and most important, worse
- [44:54] economic outcomes for our fellow
- [44:57] citizens. Now, this all might strike you
- [44:59] as quite a surprise to
- [45:02] hear because we central bankers are
- [45:04] trained to be careful with our critiques
- [45:07] lest the daylight reveal the magic.
- [45:10] A bigger risk, it strikes me, is that of
- [45:13] the sorcerer's apprentice, the misuse of
- [45:16] magical powers producing
- [45:18] trouble. Assembled in this room are dear
- [45:22] friends who served with me in the
- [45:23] financial crisis, colleagues who served
- [45:26] with me on the G30, who are doing their
- [45:28] best in our country and around the world
- [45:31] to strengthen the economy to ensure duty
- [45:34] to its remits in various places. We're
- [45:37] stewards of good and important purposes.
- [45:40] We can ill afford the closing of the
- [45:42] monetary mind. And if anything today,
- [45:45] what I hope for is a richer discourse
- [45:47] and a richer
- [45:49] inquiry. We should be a bit less worried
- [45:52] about violating pieties, prepared to
- [45:54] endure periodic frowns of
- [45:57] disapproval because the benefits are
- [45:59] huge. We can reclaim our intellectual
- [46:02] freedom. We can get policy back on
- [46:04] track. We can get stable prices and
- [46:06] strong economic outcomes. Central bank
- [46:09] legitimacy demands nothing less. I
- [46:12] appreciate your time. Thank you for
- [46:13] listening. Ragu, please come on up and
- [46:16] uh rough me up a bit.
- [46:36] So Kevin, uh, thanks. Thank you very
- [46:40] much for that fantastic lecture. And,
- [46:43] uh, if you were the substitute teacher,
- [46:45] I think the main teacher is out of a job
- [46:47] now.
- [46:49] I'm not touching that one.
- [46:51] But let me assure
- [46:54] you, but not that main teacher. You
- [46:57] meant Mark. H. No, I didn't. Let me
- [47:01] assure you, you were our first choice.
- [47:02] So, thank you very much for doing it.
- [47:04] And it was a treat. Now, unfortunately,
- [47:07] I agree pretty much with everything you
- [47:09] said. So, I don't really have a
- [47:12] question, which is actually good for
- [47:13] everyone in the audience because it
- [47:15] gives you more time. So can I ask uh
- [47:20] anyone who has a question to stand up
- [47:23] and uh the mics are around in the aisle
- [47:26] and just uh raise your hand uh stand up
- [47:30] indicate your name and institution while
- [47:32] asking the question and uh and please go
- [47:36] ahead. So
- [47:38] uh gentlemen out
- [47:44] there thank you very much. Well, the Q&A
- [47:47] session started very quickly. Uh Paul
- [47:49] Sheared, um Governor Walsh, you talked a
- [47:52] lot about uh central bank independence
- [47:54] at the end. You talked about uh the
- [47:56] critique of fiscal policy and sort of
- [47:59] maybe some blurring of the lines there,
- [48:00] but could you say a little bit about how
- [48:03] you think monetary policy can or could
- [48:07] or should or should not be coordinated
- [48:09] with fiscal policy? It's a good and fair
- [48:12] question. and it's probably the subject
- [48:14] of a of another lecture. Um, I would say
- [48:18] that the that inevitably in crisis, we
- [48:22] have to admit that there is some
- [48:24] blurring in the edges. In the darkest
- [48:27] days of 2008 or 2009,
- [48:30] um, the biggest fights weren't always
- [48:32] what to do. It was who's going to do
- [48:34] what.
- [48:36] In some ways for governments, I'm sure
- [48:38] this is true for the IMF, for the
- [48:39] managing director too, the the question
- [48:42] isn't what's the right policy, it's who
- [48:46] chooses. So in crisis, I would say those
- [48:48] lines are quite different. In normal
- [48:51] times and you know when we uh have
- [48:55] strong economies, we're basically um
- [48:59] abiding by remitt. the central bank
- [49:01] needs to keep its head down and needs to
- [49:04] focus on its tools, its powers, and its
- [49:07] influences. Um, and the fiscal
- [49:09] authorities are going to do what they're
- [49:11] going to do. I don't tend to be a fan of
- [49:14] central banking urging the fiscal
- [49:16] authorities, at least around here, to
- [49:17] spend more. This is like um asking my
- [49:20] dog if he wants to go for another hike.
- [49:23] Um, so so there's a line there. The
- [49:26] Treasury Fed Accord 1951 reads pretty
- [49:28] well. If you go back and you say what
- [49:31] are the responsibilities of the fiscal
- [49:33] authorities, what do the elected
- [49:34] representatives get to choose? And then
- [49:36] the central bank gets to say they've
- [49:38] made their choice and sequentially we
- [49:41] now get to make
- [49:42] ours. In my view, which is not so
- [49:45] commonly taught in introductory
- [49:47] macroeconomics anymore, spending matters
- [49:50] to inflation too. It is not just the
- [49:53] monetary printing that matters, but both
- [49:56] are forms of the creation of money and
- [49:58] they both matter. This is heretical in
- [50:00] some economics departments. Um, but I I
- [50:03] guess the simple answer to your question
- [50:05] is in normal times the Fed should
- [50:07] respect the decisions that are made by
- [50:10] those authorities and look around and
- [50:12] then ask themselves what they should do.
- [50:15] And what bothers me most is when we're
- [50:18] doing the buying of the debt from our
- [50:21] own government in normal times at full
- [50:23] employment and price stability. I have
- [50:26] to ask the question because I think I
- [50:28] was critical enough up there. Is that
- [50:30] really fiscal policy by other means?
- [50:33] Have we then decided to cross the lines
- [50:35] in normal times? And so mine is really a
- [50:38] a call to reinstate the accord from
- [50:42] 1951. And I recognize that there's a
- [50:44] reason why the Treasury Secretary and
- [50:46] the Fed chair meet every week. Um it's
- [50:49] because there is some natural overlap.
- [50:52] There is some coordination. I'm not
- [50:54] trying to be naive or innocent about it,
- [50:56] but we central bankers, we should really
- [50:58] let the rest of government do their bit
- [51:00] and then we can do ours. So, um let me
- [51:04] take the prerogative of asking you a
- [51:06] question in the middle which is um looks
- [51:10] uh you did a lot during the global
- [51:12] financial crisis and few would dispute
- [51:15] the need to do that at that time. But of
- [51:18] course you also talked about this in
- [51:20] your in your in your speech which is as
- [51:23] central banks expand there's a risk of
- [51:26] going beyond the remit at some point and
- [51:29] certainly you know treating what you did
- [51:31] then as business as usual in normal
- [51:33] times is going to be way beyond your
- [51:36] remitt. Yeah. How do you put the genie
- [51:38] back in the bottle? How do you how do
- [51:40] you say how do you tell the markets
- [51:43] don't expect this from us again? That
- [51:45] was a one time uh and you know we need
- [51:48] another great depression to do it again
- [51:50] but not before. Yeah. So it's a great
- [51:52] question. So the naive answer is will
- [51:56] you just seamlessly return to the status
- [51:57] quo antie as if nothing ever happened
- [52:00] but it's naive. That's the essence of
- [52:02] Ragu's question. um we decided to cross
- [52:06] lines in the global financial crisis and
- [52:09] in the pandemic came they decided to
- [52:12] cross those same lines. Seeing that was
- [52:15] not enough they had to cross more. I
- [52:18] think the best that you can do is to do
- [52:20] two
- [52:21] things. Ask yourself are there things we
- [52:24] can better do to mitigate the risks of
- [52:26] these shocks happening so frequently. So
- [52:29] the 2008 financial crisis by broad um
- [52:33] histories was a banking crisis and in my
- [52:37] judgment had the Fed not stood in the
- [52:40] global banking system would have proven
- [52:43] insolvent. Um we worked of course with
- [52:45] central bankers around the world to
- [52:47] address that. But it begs the question
- [52:50] how could we have put ourselves in that
- [52:52] situation? We have large groups across
- [52:55] three federal regulators in the US that
- [52:57] are in the business of banking
- [52:58] supervision and regulation. The world
- [53:00] has many more. We meet frequently in
- [53:02] Basil, Switzerland. And yet, if I ask
- [53:06] myself, were the reforms that we put in
- [53:08] place after the financial crisis up to
- [53:11] the task of dealing with another shock?
- [53:14] We have a bit of a natural experiment.
- [53:16] February 2023, we had two relatively
- [53:19] small, inconsequential banks.
- [53:22] um a robust regulatory and supervisory
- [53:25] system should have had a way of dealing
- [53:28] with it. After all, we central bankers
- [53:29] said after08, "Never again. We're not
- [53:32] going to let that happen." Well, the
- [53:34] natural experiment revealed some
- [53:36] weaknesses to be kind about the policies
- [53:39] we then put in place. And markets then
- [53:42] saw that then officials came to their
- [53:44] rescue. I'm a little less critical,
- [53:47] Ragu, of what do crisis manager in
- [53:50] crisis. I understand that I'm more
- [53:53] critical about what we do to mitigate
- [53:55] the crisis. So, one thing you can do is
- [53:57] try to have fewer shocks and that
- [53:59] requires a ruthless pragmatism about
- [54:02] what we get right and what we get wrong.
- [54:04] Not just blurring it over and saying,
- [54:05] "Well, it was only two little banks and
- [54:07] everything swell." And sure, we
- [54:09] backstopped all the deposits in the US
- [54:11] using executive authority, but nothing
- [54:13] to see here. That tells us that we
- [54:16] didn't do as good a job as we could
- [54:17] have. So, that's the first thing we can
- [54:18] do. try to mitigate shocks because they
- [54:21] seem to be coming more frequently in the
- [54:24] 21st century at least in economic terms
- [54:26] than they did now. Your forecasting uh
- [54:29] can be better than mine but doesn't look
- [54:31] like an easy environment in front of us
- [54:32] the next five or 10 years. So what else
- [54:35] can we do when we have periods of
- [54:38] relative peace and prosperity between
- [54:41] shocks? We have to have the rhetoric and
- [54:44] the reality of we're going back to our
- [54:47] normal business. This story has more
- [54:50] going forth than adivism. This is the
- [54:52] more that markets and market
- [54:54] participants and businesses and banks
- [54:56] say, "Boy, they sure seem different now.
- [54:59] They were crisis managers a few years
- [55:00] ago. They look kind of different. Their
- [55:03] policies are different. They've taken
- [55:05] their monetary policies back to a more
- [55:07] traditional place. They're not
- [55:09] spoonfeeding us like they did in the
- [55:11] crisis, telling us, "Don't worry,
- [55:12] everything will be okay on Monday."
- [55:14] the more we comport in our daily
- [55:17] business like every day is a crisis, the
- [55:19] more we ask for greater crises and ask
- [55:22] us to cross lines. So those are two
- [55:23] suggestions. They're not perfect and I
- [55:26] wish I could say we could go back to the
- [55:28] world before08. We can't, but we need to
- [55:30] address that in I think a more
- [55:32] fundamental honest way than we have to
- [55:34] this point.
- [55:36] Axel then Jacob, these are friends now.
- [55:39] If these are not if these are not
- [55:40] softball questions, I'm going to be very
- [55:42] disappointed.
- [55:48] Kevin, I feel very reassured that you
- [55:51] referred a lot to the principles of
- [55:52] central banking and the three of us,
- [55:54] Jacob, Ragu and me uh wrote a paper on
- [55:56] that in the group of 30. So uh I have a
- [55:59] question on two issues. Uh one dvtales
- [56:02] on what Ragu said. The central bank
- [56:05] balance sheet and involvement in markets
- [56:08] is tenfold of what it was before the
- [56:11] crisis and also the international role
- [56:14] of the Federal Reserve through swap
- [56:16] lines has become a way of operating a
- [56:20] crisis. How can you
- [56:22] practically what do you need to do to
- [56:25] push back from that central involvement
- [56:28] in the markets and as a sort of you know
- [56:32] denominator of the international system
- [56:34] and are there risks in this juncture in
- [56:37] more of a peace time for the Fed to
- [56:40] retreat from those sort of roles that
- [56:42] they involved that it involved into but
- [56:44] that that weren't invis 40 50 years ago.
- [56:47] So my given given the uh limited time
- [56:50] let me ask Jacob also to ask question
- [56:52] and get one more question from there and
- [56:54] perhaps you can ask answer all three uh
- [56:57] depending on the
- [56:59] up here
- [57:03] uh thank you well this was a tour the
- [57:06] fourth amazing I have a very
- [57:10] simple-minded
- [57:11] question I was standing in line in the
- [57:15] supermarket and the lady in front of me
- [57:17] picked up the
- [57:19] newspaper and the title was the Fed is
- [57:23] meeting its inflation
- [57:26] target and then she went to the cashier
- [57:29] and said what are they talking about
- [57:31] prices are so high and I'm paying so
- [57:34] much so the idea of the distinction
- [57:37] price level rates of inflation where all
- [57:39] central banks are focusing on the rates
- [57:41] of inflation not dealing with past
- [57:44] deviations that created high crisis
- [57:46] leaves a challenge. How do we deal with
- [57:49] it? One last question uh out
- [57:53] there and if you could state your name
- [57:56] please and institution.
- [57:58] Good evening. Um Brunell Rosa from Rosa
- [58:01] and Rubini. Uh we are an inflection
- [58:04] point in the monetary system if you want
- [58:07] with the introduction of digital
- [58:09] currencies. The Fed has just uh uh
- [58:12] withdrawn some of the statement made
- [58:14] with the OCC and
- [58:16] FDIC on for example stable coins.
- [58:20] Somebody feel that the introduction of
- [58:22] the stable coins the way they are
- [58:24] proposed by the genius and stable acts
- [58:26] would be a keen return to the free
- [58:28] banking which was preceding the
- [58:31] foundation of uh the federal and other
- [58:34] central banks. What would be your
- [58:36] opinion on that? Thank you. Sure.
- [58:39] So that feast do I get to choose or I
- [58:42] answer all uh pick whatever you want to
- [58:45] answer and I I just wanted to give you
- [58:47] some I appreciate it. Uh thank you for
- [58:50] the softball questions for my friends.
- [58:52] My goodness. Um so first um to Axel and
- [58:56] the question which in some sense
- [58:58] consumes a lot of our discussions when
- [59:00] we're whispering among each other is so
- [59:03] you now have this 7 trillion dollar
- [59:04] balance sheet. Admittedly, it's down
- [59:06] about 30% from its from its post
- [59:09] pandemic high. So, what do you do with
- [59:11] it? How do you deal with it? And I would
- [59:14] try, well, let's try plainly and
- [59:16] honestly. Let's give that a shot. Um, we
- [59:20] created this balance sheet for two
- [59:23] reasons. in the '08 crisis and in most
- [59:25] the times that it surged afterwards
- [59:29] um we were stuck at the zero lower bound
- [59:31] and we were looking for more looseness
- [59:32] because zero was not low enough in the
- [59:34] OA crisis and I believed it then I still
- [59:37] believe it so we were using the balance
- [59:40] sheet because that was monetary policy
- [59:42] by other means parenthetically we also
- [59:45] used it to bring liquidity into
- [59:46] financial markets because that's our job
- [59:49] when on the run off ther run treasury
- [59:50] spreads are wide it's our job not to set
- [59:53] the price, but it's central bank's job
- [59:55] to bring liquidity so the price can be
- [59:58] set. But on the first point, if it was
- [01:00:01] monetary policy when we grew the balance
- [01:00:04] sheet, how could it not be monetary
- [01:00:06] policy on the other end? Now, we have a
- [01:00:10] tendency in central banking circles to
- [01:00:12] say, well, we have very large balance
- [01:00:14] sheet. Don't look at that. That has
- [01:00:16] nothing to do with monetary policy.
- [01:00:18] That's about excess reserves and banking
- [01:00:20] and liquidity. Um I think we need to be
- [01:00:24] upfront about was it then monetary
- [01:00:26] policy and is it not now monetary policy
- [01:00:30] and if it is the Fed has a couple of
- [01:00:32] tools that it can work with in the
- [01:00:33] conduct of monetary policy and on the
- [01:00:36] question of bringing uh liquidity to
- [01:00:39] markets. This is at core what the Fed
- [01:00:42] was created to do more than 100 years
- [01:00:43] ago. So if we're growing the balance
- [01:00:46] sheet because of illlquid markets by
- [01:00:48] buying treasuries because there's a gap
- [01:00:50] in the fives or the sevens that's okay
- [01:00:52] but we should call it that. So I
- [01:00:55] understand just like the question of
- [01:00:56] fiscal and monetary policy, we cannot be
- [01:00:58] pure academics on this and say there's
- [01:01:00] these dividing lines we'll never cross.
- [01:01:02] But I think a little more cander about
- [01:01:04] the rationale for the balance sheet,
- [01:01:06] what our intents are rather than to
- [01:01:08] suggest somehow we're now stuck with a
- [01:01:10] large large balance sheet and we'll be
- [01:01:12] buying debts from our own government for
- [01:01:14] the rest of time strikes me as as as as
- [01:01:18] a very different message to the broader
- [01:01:20] point I think both from Axel and Jacob
- [01:01:23] about the US the Federal Reserve. First,
- [01:01:26] in all of Jacob's stories, there's
- [01:01:28] always a kernel of truth. The thing that
- [01:01:29] was not true in his is there are no
- [01:01:31] newspapers anymore. Jacob, people don't
- [01:01:34] they don't go to the store. They don't
- [01:01:35] have them at the store. But he was
- [01:01:37] making a point about the Federal Reserve
- [01:01:39] and the rest. Listen, because of the
- [01:01:42] inheritance of Chairman Pal and his gang
- [01:01:46] of central bankers, chairman uh uh
- [01:01:49] Bernani and his gang of central bankers
- [01:01:52] and because of the incredible vibrancy
- [01:01:54] and resiliency of the US economy since
- [01:01:58] 1946. It is understandable that the US
- [01:02:01] Treasury and the Federal Reserve would
- [01:02:02] be playing a very large role in the
- [01:02:06] economy. It's very understandable that
- [01:02:09] the dollar is the world's reserve
- [01:02:10] currency and plays this incredibly
- [01:02:12] important role. Those are all of course
- [01:02:15] true. But we central bankers, we don't
- [01:02:18] need to demonstrate that every day. It's
- [01:02:20] demonstrated by the dynamism of the
- [01:02:22] economy, by the prudence of our
- [01:02:23] policies, by the legacies we've
- [01:02:26] inherited in the choices that we make.
- [01:02:28] So I understand this is not saying US is
- [01:02:31] just another country and we should leave
- [01:02:33] the main stage and you know just sort of
- [01:02:36] keep our heads down. We have important
- [01:02:37] responsibilities and my view is the
- [01:02:40] better the rest of the world's economy
- [01:02:42] the more that spills back into our
- [01:02:44] economy. So I'm sympathetic with that
- [01:02:46] notion but that doesn't mean that we
- [01:02:48] central bankers need to stay on the
- [01:02:50] front pages of of these newspapers every
- [01:02:52] day. There will come a time where we
- [01:02:54] need to get back on the front pages and
- [01:02:57] it's better if we get back on them from
- [01:02:58] page B12 of the business section where
- [01:03:01] there's a little six paragraph line
- [01:03:03] written by a reporter you've never heard
- [01:03:05] of and it says the Federal Reserve today
- [01:03:07] raised rates a quarter, cut them a
- [01:03:08] quarter and nothing to see here. In
- [01:03:11] normal times, that's where that by line
- [01:03:13] should be to the question of the central
- [01:03:15] bank digital currency and then you're
- [01:03:17] going to give me the either another
- [01:03:18] question or or or pull me off stage.
- [01:03:22] Um, we central bankers, they central
- [01:03:25] bankers, I'm a hasb been central
- [01:03:27] bankers, um, we're in the wholesale
- [01:03:29] business. We ought not be in the retail
- [01:03:31] business. It is the decision of
- [01:03:34] Congress, the decision of the executive
- [01:03:35] branch, if they want to create a US
- [01:03:38] dollar stable coin, if they want to have
- [01:03:40] a central bank digital currency, that's
- [01:03:42] their decision.
- [01:03:44] And if it's a retail
- [01:03:46] product, I wouldn't very much want the
- [01:03:49] central bank to be too involved in that.
- [01:03:52] Um, I'm worried already that when people
- [01:03:55] are looking for money and they go to the
- [01:03:57] appropriations committee and the
- [01:03:59] appropriations committee says no, they
- [01:04:01] then come down to the Federal Reserve as
- [01:04:02] if we're the appeals court for fiscal
- [01:04:04] policy. I don't need when the next
- [01:04:06] crisis comes for 300 million Americans
- [01:04:09] to have accounts at the central bank.
- [01:04:11] Congress is having a hard time figuring
- [01:04:13] out how to pay for something and then
- [01:04:14] they just say, "Well, why don't you guys
- [01:04:16] just fill up those accounts?" My view is
- [01:04:19] this whole discussion of cryptocurrency
- [01:04:22] is mostly, I think,
- [01:04:24] misunderstood. Um, this new technology
- [01:04:27] is software. There's nothing secret
- [01:04:30] about it, hence the word crypto. And
- [01:04:32] currency, well, that sounds like money.
- [01:04:35] This is software. And if our government,
- [01:04:38] the executive branch and Congress say
- [01:04:39] that they want to have a stable coin,
- [01:04:41] that's a wonderful decision for them to
- [01:04:43] make and the Fed should be playing no
- [01:04:45] role in that. What we should be playing
- [01:04:47] a role in and have long played a role in
- [01:04:49] is the wholesale funding model. What
- [01:04:52] happens when this money goes between one
- [01:04:54] bank and another? What happens when the
- [01:04:55] central bank is playing in the interbank
- [01:04:57] market? Well, there there's huge reforms
- [01:05:00] that I think can be had, and we can move
- [01:05:02] to a system that is more secure, is more
- [01:05:05] reliable, is more instantaneous, and
- [01:05:08] using some of this new technology is
- [01:05:10] certainly a very prudent way to do it.
- [01:05:13] That's in the province of the central
- [01:05:14] bank. Everything else is in the province
- [01:05:16] of the executives. Well, thank you very
- [01:05:18] much, Kevin. Um, you know, you said
- [01:05:21] central bank, you're not a central
- [01:05:23] banker. Central bankers never retire.
- [01:05:25] They don't even fade away. I think
- [01:05:27] they're always with us. So, thank you
- [01:05:29] very much for that. Uh, please join me
- [01:05:31] in thanking Kevin for those wonderful
- [01:05:41] remarks. I also want to thank managing
- [01:05:44] director George Eva for her opening
- [01:05:46] remarks and for the IMF uh to the IMF
- [01:05:48] for hosting us as well as all the fun
- [01:05:51] staff who was helped in making this uh
- [01:05:54] event possible. Um we welcome all of you
- [01:05:58] to join us for a reception outside and
- [01:06:01] thank you very much again for coming
- [01:06:03] today and hope you will participate in
- [01:06:06] future such events. Thanks.
- [01:06:08] Thank you. Fantastic. Thank you.
