- **A2**: Growth weakening (GDP <2%, unemployment rising)

### Node B: Inflation falling (CPI declining toward 2%)
- **B1**: Growth stable (GDP >2%)
- **B2**: Growth weakening (GDP <2%, recession risk)

### Node C: Financial stability stress
- **C1**: Liquidity shock (2+ panic indicators triggered)
- **C2**: Credit shock (spreads blowing out, no liquidity freeze)

---

## Policy response expectations

### A1: High inflation + Stable growth
**Scenario**: "No-brainer tightening"

**Warsh Policy Stance**: **Aggressive tightening, zero hesitation**

**Expected Actions**:
1. **Immediate rate hikes**: Front-load tightening
   - No "gradual" or "data dependent"
   - Quote [2021-06]: When CPI 5%+, should act immediately
2. **Balance sheet runoff**: Accelerate QT
   - No "price maker" in Treasury market
   - Return to pre-crisis levels
3. **Communication**: Reject "transitory", commit to price stability
   - Quote [38:50, G30]: "Inflation was 2% because they said so" (批评)
   - Restore credibility through action

**Threshold for this node**:
- CPI: >4-5% for 2+ consecutive readings
- Core inflation: Also elevated
- Growth: GDP >2%, unemployment <5%
- No recession signals

**Historical example**: 2021年中
- CPI reached 5%+
- Growth strong, unemployment falling
- Warsh: "Not transitory", immediate action needed
- Fed: Kept saying "transitory", no action until 2022-03

**Investment implications**:
- **If Warsh in charge**: Immediate hawkish pivot
  - Rates: ↑↑ (front-loaded)
  - Duration: 大幅做空 (yield curve steepen)
  - Equities: 估值压力 (especially growth/tech)
  - USD: ↑ (aggressive Fed)
  - Commodities: ↓ (demand destruction)

- **If Fed ignores** (Powell-style):
  - Trust Warsh historical accuracy
  - Position for eventual forced tightening
  - Inflation will persist → Fed behind curve

**Risk**: None for Warsh - 绝对优先级是price stability

---

### A2: High inflation + Weakening growth
**Scenario**: "Stagflation test" - The ultimate test of priority ordering

**Warsh Policy Stance**: **Still tighten, price stability > growth**

**Expected Actions**:
1. **Continue tightening** despite growth weakness
   - Quote [36:45, G30]: Price stability >> employment
   - Reject "a little more inflation for less unemployment" [2010-03, FRASER]
2. **No pivot to easing**: Will accept recession to restore price stability
   - Historical reference: Volcker 1980-82
   - Quote [2025, G30]: 9.1% inflation = "greatest mistake in 45 years"
3. **Supply-side focus** instead of demand stimulus
   - Quote [2010-11, FRASER]: "Fed is not repair shop for broken fiscal/trade policies"
   - Advocate pro-growth policies (regulatory, fiscal reform)

**Threshold**:
- CPI: Still >4-5%
- Growth: <2%, possibly negative
- Unemployment: Rising (say 6-7%)
- Risk: Recession

**Historical near-miss**: 2022年下半年
- CPI still 7-8% (从9.1%峰值下降中)
- Growth slowing, recession fears
- Fed: Continued hiking but signaled pivot coming
- Warsh would likely: Keep hiking until CPI <4%

**Key principle** [2010-03, FRASER]:
> "Internal risk: Accepting 'a little more inflation for less unemployment'"
- Warsh explicitly rejects this 1970s error

**Investment implications**:
- **Most difficult scenario for markets**:
  - Rates: ↑ (Fed tightening into weakness)
  - Duration: Mixed (recession vs Fed hiking)
  - Equities: ↓↓ (earnings ↓, multiples ↓)
  - Credit: Widening (recession + high rates)
  - USD: ↑ (Fed prioritizing inflation)
  - Commodities: ↓ (demand destruction)
  - **Best position**: Cash, short-term Treasuries, wait for clearing

**Warsh tolerance**: High for short-term pain to achieve price stability
- Quote [2009-04, FRASER]: "Fluctuations in output and employment are unavoidable"

---

### B1: Inflation falling + Stable growth
**Scenario**: "Soft landing achieved"

**Warsh Policy Stance**: **Cautious normalization, vigilance**

**Expected Actions**:
1. **Hold rates** until inflation convincingly at 2%
   - No premature easing
   - "Trust but verify" approach
2. **Accelerate balance sheet runoff**
   - Quote [2009-04, FRASER]: "When panics subside, Fed should retrace its steps"
   - Return to $1T target quickly
3. **Reduce Fed communication**
   - Quote [22:50, G30]: "Working without applause"
   - No forward guidance in normal times
   - Move to "page B12" of newspapers

**Threshold**:
- CPI: Trending toward 2% (say 2.5-3%)
- Growth: Healthy (GDP 2-3%)
- Unemployment: Stable (4-5%)
- No financial stress

**Historical example**: What 2024 could have been if Fed acted in 2021
- Warsh would normalize quickly
- No extended "higher for longer"
- Trust market's own adjustment

**Key principle** [2010-03, FRASER]:
> "Fed must stay within its role as liquidity provider"
- In normal times, minimize presence

**Investment implications**:
- **Goldilocks for risk assets** (if achieved):
  - Rates: Stable to slightly ↓
  - Duration: Neutral to slightly long
  - Equities: ↑ (growth + stable rates)
  - Credit: Tighten (risk-on)
  - USD: Dependent on global relative
  - Commodities: Growth-driven

- **Warsh caveat**: Watch for next shock
  - Quote [2010-11, FRASER]: Must have "clear, consistent rules" to prevent next crisis
  - Regulatory vigilance high

**Risk management**: Still normalize balance sheet aggressively
- Don't leave crisis tools in place during normal times

---

### B2: Inflation falling + Weakening growth
**Scenario**: "Disinflationary recession"

**Warsh Policy Stance**: **Conditional easing, but balance sheet discipline**

**Expected Actions**:
1. **Rate cuts** if inflation truly subdued
   - Threshold: CPI <3% and falling
   - Would use rates as primary tool
2. **NO balance sheet expansion** unless panic
   - Quote [2010-06, FRASER]: "Past point of diminishing returns"
   - QE only if 2+ panic indicators triggered
3. **Distinguish** recession from panic
   - Quote [2009-04, FRASER]: "Panics involve loss of confidence in financial system"
   - Recession = normal fluctuation
   - Panic = systemic breakdown

**Threshold**:
- CPI: <3% and falling
- Growth: Negative (recession)
- Unemployment: Rising (say 6-7%)
- Financial markets: Orderly (no panic)

**Decision tree**:
```
IF CPI <3% AND recession AND no panic indicators
THEN cut rates moderately
BUT NO QE (normal recession tool = rates only)

IF panic indicators (2+) triggered
THEN aggressive balance sheet expansion justified
SEE Node C1
```

**Historical contrast**:
- **2008-09**: Panic → Supported QE1 ✅
- **2010 QE2**: No panic, growth positive → Opposed ❌ → Resigned

**Key quote** [2009-04, FRASER]:
> "Fluctuations in economic output and employment are unavoidable"
- Don't try to eliminate every recession
- Focus on preventing panics

**Investment implications**:
- **Typical recession playbook**:
  - Rates: ↓ (Fed cuts)
  - Duration: ↑ (long bonds rally)
  - Equities: ↓ (recession) then ↑ (Fed cuts)
  - Credit: Widen then recover
  - USD: ↓ (Fed easing)
  - Commodities: ↓ (demand)

- **Warsh difference**: No QE sugar high
  - Cleaner, quicker recovery
  - No asset bubble inflation
  - No "Fed put" at every dip

**Risk tolerance**: Accept normal business cycle pain

---

### C1: Liquidity shock (Systemic panic)
**Scenario**: "2008-style crisis"

**Warsh Policy Stance**: **Aggressive intervention, "whatever it takes"**

**Expected Actions**:
1. **Massive balance sheet expansion**
   - Quote [2009-04, FRASER]: Supported QE1 as necessary
   - Quote [27:45, G30-2025]: "Strongly supported this crisis time innovation"
2. **Lender of last resort**
   - Provide liquidity to dysfunctional markets
   - Quote [2010-03, FRASER]: "Stay within role as liquidity provider"
3. **Crisis communication**
   - Forward guidance acceptable [22:45, G30]: "In crisis times"
   - Commit to not quitting

**Panic trigger thresholds** (2009 framework):
Need 2+ of following:
- Household wealth: <-15 to -20%
- GDP quarterly: <-6%
- Stock market: <-40% annual
- Bank market cap: <-50%
- Unemployment: Rapid surge >8-9%
- Money market: Freezes, runs, spread blowouts

**Examples**:
- 2008: ✅ All 6 indicators → Supported aggressive action
- 2020 COVID: March ✅ Several indicators → Would support
- 2023 SVB: ❌ Only 1-2 indicators → Critical of response [54:10, G30]

**Duration of intervention**:
> [2009-04, FRASER] "The Panic began before the recession and will assuredly end before it"
- Intervention ends when panic subsides
- NOT when recession ends
- Must "retrace steps" immediately

**Investment implications**:
- **During panic**:
  - Rates: ↓↓ (zero bound)
  - Duration: ↑↑ (flight to safety)
  - Equities: ↓↓ then stabilize
  - Credit: Blowout then Fed support
  - USD: ↑ (safe haven) or ↓ (if US-origin)
  - Commodities: ↓↓ (demand collapse)
  - **Cash is king** initially

- **Post-Fed intervention**:
  - Markets stabilize quickly
  - Fed credibility high (if decisive)
  - Recovery stronger than expected

- **Exit phase** (Warsh unique):
  - Fed will "retrace steps" faster than market expects
  - No extended QE like 2010-2014
  - Asset prices may correct when Fed exits

**Key difference from Powell Fed**:
- **Warsh**: In aggressively, out quickly
- **Powell**: In aggressively, stay forever

---

### C2: Credit shock (No liquidity freeze)
**Scenario**: "Spread widening without systemic freeze"

**Warsh Policy Stance**: **Limited intervention, let markets clear**

**Expected Actions**:
1. **Rates cut** if needed for macro
   - Traditional monetary policy
2. **NO balance sheet intervention**
   - This is not liquidity problem
   - This is credit/solvency problem
   - Quote [2010-03, FRASER]: Fed is "liquidity provider" not "capital allocator"
3. **Regulatory response** instead
   - Quote [54:10, G30]: "Ruthless pragmatism about failures"
   - Find regulatory gaps, fix them
   - Don't bail out bad actors

**Distinction from C1**:
- C1 = Liquidity freeze → Fed's job
- C2 = Credit quality concern → NOT Fed's job

**Threshold**:
- Credit spreads: Widening (say IG +200bp, HY +500bp)
- But markets still functioning
- No money market freeze
- <2 panic indicators

**Examples**:
- 2023 SVB: Credit/solvency issue
  - Warsh critical: Regulatory failure [54:10, G30]
  - Should NOT have backstopped all deposits
- Hypothetical corporate credit cycle: Let it clear

**Key principle** [2010-03, FRASER]:
> "Capital allocations reside with fiscal authority and Treasury"
- Fed providing capital = mission creep
- This jeopardizes independence

**Investment implications**:
- **Spreads widen**:
  - Credit: ↓ (spreads widen, some defaults)
  - Equities: Sector-specific (financials ↓)
  - Rates: ↓ (flight to safety)
  - Duration: ↑ (safety bid)

- **No Fed put**:
  - Markets need to price credit risk properly
  - Losers lose, winners win
  - Differentiation among firms [2009-04, FRASER]

- **Opportunity**:
  - Buy quality credits at wide spreads
  - Avoid junk (no Fed bailout)
  - Favor strong balance sheets

**Warsh tolerance**: High for market clearing
- "Creative destruction" acceptable
- Prevents moral hazard

## Scenario probability assessment (Warsh lens)

### Most likely under Warsh Fed

**B1 or A1** (depending on starting conditions)
- Warsh focus on price stability → Likely achieves it
- Credible commitment → Inflation expectations anchored
- Quick normalization → Healthy growth

### Least likely under Warsh Fed

**A2** (Stagflation)
- Because Warsh would act early at A1
- Prevents inflation from becoming entrenched
- 2021-22 wouldn't have happened under Warsh

### Current Fed (Powell) most likely

**A2** (Stagflation) - Because:
- Delayed response to A1 (2021)
- Inflation becomes entrenched
- Eventually forced to tighten into weakness

---

## Node transition dynamics

### Paths under Warsh vs. Powell

**Warsh**:
```
A1 → (aggressive tightening) → B1 → (normalize) → Stable
Time: Shorter, sharper, cleaner
```

**Powell**:
```
A1 → (delay, "transitory") → A1 → (still delay) → A2 → (forced tightening) → B2/recession
Time: Longer, messier, more painful
```

**Historical validation**: 2021-2024 followed Powell path

## Evidence links

### Node A1 (High inflation + Stable growth)
- [2021-06, WSJ]: "Fill the punch bowl" - CPI 5%+, growth strong, should tighten
- [2021-12, WSJ]: "Fed is main culprit" - CPI 7%+, no action yet
- [38:50, G30-2025]: "Inflation was 2% because they said so" (self-executing assumption critique)

### Node A2 (High inflation + Weak growth)
- [2010-03, FRASER]: "Accepting 'a little more inflation for less unemployment'" = 1970s error
- [36:45, G30-2025]: "What an individual does... matters immeasurably" (focus on individuals not groups)
- [36:25, G30-2025]: "Steepest price paid by supposed beneficiaries" (inclusive employment cost)

### Node B1 (Falling inflation + Stable growth)
- [2009-04, FRASER]: "When panics subside, Fed should retrace its steps"
- [22:50, G30-2025]: "Working without applause" (normal times Fed should be quiet)
- [24:50, G30-2025]: "Fed should exit main stage" when conditions normalize

### Node B2 (Falling inflation + Weak growth)
- [2009-04, FRASER]: "Fluctuations in output and employment are unavoidable"
- [2010-06, FRASER]: "Past point of diminishing returns" (re: QE in non-panic)
- Distinction: Would use rates, not QE, for normal recession

### Node C1 (Liquidity shock / Panic)
- [2009-04, FRASER]: Panic = "loss of confidence... even sound firms can't borrow"
- [2009-04, FRASER]: Quantitative panic indicators (6 metrics)
- [27:45, G30-2025]: "Strongly supported this crisis time innovation" (QE1)
- [2010-03, FRASER]: "Stay within role as liquidity provider"

### Node C2 (Credit shock without panic)
- [2010-03, FRASER]: "Capital allocations reside with fiscal authority"
- [54:10, G30-2025]: "Ruthless pragmatism about failures" (SVB 2023)
- [2009-04, FRASER]: "Encourage differentiation among firms"

## Special scenarios

### Scenario X: Fed ignoring Warsh framework
**If Fed under Powell continues current approach**:

- **Warsh action**: Public dissent → Warning → Eventually "I told you so"
- **Investment signal**: When Warsh speaks ≠ Fed acts → Position against Fed
- **Historical accuracy**: 2021-22 inflation (★★★★★)

**Trading rule**:
```
IF Warsh publicly criticizes Fed policy
AND Fed ignores / continues anyway
THEN position for Warsh scenario (he's usually right)
```

### Scenario Y: Warsh becomes Fed Chair (2026)
**If Warsh nominated and confirmed**:

- **Immediate actions**:
  1. Accelerate balance sheet runoff
  2. Cease forward guidance
  3. Return to "narrow central banking"
  4. Focus on price stability über alles

- **Market reaction**:
  - Initial: Volatility ↑ (uncertainty)
  - Medium-term: Credibility ↑ → inflation expectations ↓
  - Long-term: Healthier business cycles

- **Asset implications**:
  - Treasuries: Term premium ↑ (no Fed bid)
  - Equities: Valuation reset ↓ but better long-term
  - Credit: Spreads normalize (no bailout expectations)
  - USD: Strengthen (credibility)
